       <ul>3. In respect of an impediment that delays, hinders, reduces or interferes with the performance of an obligation other than the delivery obligation(s), immediate postponement of those obligations without liability for damages, penalties and other contractual remedies until such time as the impediment is removed.</ul>

        <p>In relation to Covid-19, in case the berthing or discharging operations of the vessel are delayed or suspended due to the vessel failing to obtain free pratique or due to health or other authorities imposing any type of restrictions at any time during her stay in port; the time thereby lost will not count as laytime or time on demurrage and the costs of extra shiftings, if any, will be for Owner’s time and account. If, after tendering NOR, the vessel fails to obtain free pratique, such time shall not count until the vessel obtains Free Pratique.</p>

        <p>2. If any authority at the discharge port/ country issues any notification/ circular/ communique relating to the spread of the coronavirus which, in the Buyers’ reasonable judgment, shall result in measures being imposed against the vessel/ cargo/ crew by such/ any other authority and is capable of delaying the receipt of the cargo at discharge port by Buyers:</p>
        <p>a. Buyers shall be entitled to terminate this contract or postpone this contract to a mutually acceptable date without any liability to either party if the vessel has not commenced the loading operation or the vessel has been clean fixed but not reached the load port</p>
        <p>b. If cargo loading has commenced at the date of exercising the option, the Buyers have the right to require the Sellers to unload the cargo, at buyer’s cost.</p>
