  <p>Each party represents and warrants that it shall at all times comply, and require its contractors, suppliers, and

    or directors (i) is a Sanctions Restricted Person or is in any way affiliated with a Sanctions Restricted Person;
    (ii) has violated or is violating any Sanctions Laws; or (iii) shall directly or indirectly transfer to, or
    otherwise make available funds to or through, any Sanctions Restricted Person or any Restricted Territory, to the
    extent that such actions may cause such party to be in breach of any applicable law, including Sanctions Laws. Each
    party further represents and warrants that (i) it is not, directly or indirectly, owned fifty percent (50%) or more
    by (whether individually or collectively), controlled by, or operating for or on behalf of, any Sanctions Restricted
    Person, and (ii) also undertakes that the transactions it will carry out with the other will not involve in any way,
    directly or indirectly, Sanctioned Restricted Persons and/or products subject to Sanctions Laws, that the
    transactions contemplated hereunder will not in any involve or benefit Sanctions Restricted Parties (unless such
    dealings are authorized under a general license or equivalent from the relevant Governmental Authority). Each of the

    date of each shipment (purchase order), date of supply and date of payment.
    Each party (“Non-affected Party”) shall have the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice to the other party
    (“Affected Party”), without recourse and with immediate effect, when (i) the Affected Party is in breach of the
    foregoing representations and warranties, (ii) the Non-affected Party has reasons to believe that the Affected Party
    may or will be in breach of such representations and warranties, or (iii) the Non-affected Party has reasons to
    believe that any activities of or business with the Affected Party will cause the Non-affected Party (or its
    affiliates) to be in violation of any applicable laws (including but not limited to Sanctions Laws). The Affected
    Party waives its right to claim the Non-affected Party for all damages, losses, liabilities and related costs and
    expenses which it may have as a result of such termination, and shall bear any and all costs and risks for any
    present and future claims demands, obligation, proceeding, rights, damages, costs, losses, expenses, compensations,
    actions and causes of action, known or unknown, which the Non-Affected Party may incur as result of such
    designation.
